# Who are you? 
This is my 4th Javascript project where I practiced using if-else statements, arrays and loops. I made a program/game that I can actually use in the future - to facilitate conversations with friends. 

# Notes
I wanted to read the questions from a .txt file into an array, but with Javascript it's very difficult. I am only using Vanilla JS, and you need Node.js to work with files (reading and writing). So instead, I wrote some python code that takes the questions.txt file and prints a single string with the format of a javascript array, putting all the questions in. I then copied and pasted the now-array of questions as a javascript array and avoided having to use node.js. I will learn it at a later date so this will do for now.
